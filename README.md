* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

  I faced an issue to render my data and organize it in the table I had whithout constuctor I think I have to search more about how can I appendChild data to a specific td in a table


* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

  I think it's took 8 hours at least but I belive that it require more time .

    ## Please note that I console.log all data I got from Local Storage and organize it
